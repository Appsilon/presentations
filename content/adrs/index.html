          <h3>Architectural Decision Records</h3>

              So, why is this a hot topic, why somebody should be concerned about writing proper technical documentation?
              When I joined Appsilon, the first thing I went though was a bunch of pages on our Outline and this one in particular.
            </aside>
            <h2>Why ADRs?</h2>
            <a href="https://appsilon.getoutline.com/doc/how-to-write-design-docs-aANfeHwAnF"><p class="fragment"><img class="r-frame" style="background: rgba(0,0,0,0.1);" data-src="./images/outline.png"></p></a>

            <aside class="notes">
              It briefly describes Appsilon's approach to writing documentation. There's a reference at the end to an article from Google, which explains how to write
              design docs and provides a template. What's more appealing is that entire article is using the template itself.
            </aside>
            <img class="r-frame" style="background: rgba(0,0,0,0.1);" data-src="./images/outline1.png">

          <section data-background="#111319">
            <aside class="notes">
              In a nutshell, the template from Google consists of a title, some meta keys like author, status, last time updated.
              It sets up a context for your design, goals you'd like to achieve, overview, detailed design, cross-cutting concerns whatever that means, and also alternatives considered.
            </aside>

            <h2>Google Template</h2>

          <section data-background="#111319">
            <aside class="notes">
              The article is from 2015, therefore I would have suspected that it has already been widely adopted.
              When I did some research - it turned out that there's actually a dedicated term for this particular kind of document describing your design or architecture,
              and it has done even more influence comparing to the Google's one. The term was introduced by Michael Nygard in 2011.
              And this is essentially how we're going to get familiar with ADRs.

              So let's move a bit closer to the ADRs and answer a simple question: what is architecture?
              A common definition would be like this: it represents the design decisions that shape a system.

              It should be relatively easy as possible to write them down and version.

              So, let's take a look at a what a typical Markdown template would look like in ADR's world.

              And full disclosure of course: ADRs is just a concept, there's a bunch of templates available that can fit various projects, from small to larger ones.
              The template I personally find the most intuitive and easy to use is the one suggested my Michael Nygard initially in 2011.
              Conceptually, the document structure is similar to one we've seen so far. But let's take a closer look directly in the Markdown itself.

              So, in a nutshell, and ADR can be treated as a very lightweight document consisting of decision taken, it might include external links and references to third party documents whenever required, but at the same time
              the document itself stays compact and to-the-point. It might also live anywhere, in any format. Markdown though would be a preference here. A bit of a spoiler, since some of you might have guessed, the ideal place to store ADRs
              would be your project's repository.

              As always when some kind of a standard is being introduced, there's also a set of tools to interact with it. ADRs are not an exception
              and there's a plenty of open source CLI and web applications on the market that can assist you in your day-to-day work when writing documentation.
              The first one is kinda simple - it's a plain bash helper that manages the ADR Markdown files on your behalf, simplifying things like bootstrapping, adding or removing existing documents.
              The second one is a more sophisticated tool written in TypeScript, which not only has the same features as adr-tools, but also works as a static website publisher,
              allowing you to share and manage your documents in a more human-friendly way.

              Without further ado let's jump into a real life example how me and Damian started using ADRs & log4brains just recently for one of our repositories.
              Introduce log4brains, show default ADRs.
              Context: we decided to setup existing Appsilon's infrastructure in AWS from scratch by using best practices, things like zero-trust security, creating AWS accounts in an automated fashion.
              In order to do so, we first considered two available options AWS CT and Terraform.
