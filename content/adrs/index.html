					<h2>ADR Template</h2>
					<section id="adr-template">

          <aside class="notes">
            So, let's take a look at a what a typical template would look like in ADR's world.

            And full disclosure of course: ADRs is just a concept, there's a bunch of templates available that can fit various project, from small to larger ones.
            The template I personally find the most intuitive and easy to use is the one suggested my Michael Nygard in 2011, which interestingly enough is 4 year ahead the article from Google.
            Conceptually, the document structure is similar to one we've seen so far. But let's take a closer look directly in the Markdown itself.

					<h2>ADR In a nutshell</h2>

            <aside class="notes">
              So, in a nutshell, and ADR can be treated as a very lightweight document consisting of decision taken, it might include external links and reference to third party documents whenever required, but at the same time
              the document itself stays compact and to-the-point. It might also live anywhere, in any format. Markdown is a preference though. A bit of a spoiler, since some of you might have guessed, the ideal place to store ADRs
              would be your project's repository.

            <aside class="notes">
              As always when some kind of a standard is being introduced, there's also a set of tools to interact with it. ADRs are not an exception
              and there's a plenty of open source CLI and web applications on the market that can assist you in your day-to-day work when writing documentation.
              The first one is kinda simple - it's a plain bash helper that manages the ADR Markdown files on your behalf, simplifying things like bootstrapping, adding or removing existing documents.
              The second one is a more sophisticated tool written in TypeScript, which not only has the same features as adr-tools, but also works as a static website publisher,
              allowing you to share and manage your documents in a more human-friendly way.

              Demo
            <aside class="notes">
              Without further ado let's jump into a real life example how me and Damian started using ADRs & log4brains just recently for one of our repositories.

              Context: we decided to setup existing Appsilon's infrastructure in AWS from scratch by using best practices, things like zero-trust security, creating AWS accounts in an automated fashion.
              In order to do so, we first considered two available options AWS CT and Terraform.
